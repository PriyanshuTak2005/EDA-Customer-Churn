# 📊 Customer Churn EDA Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to understand the key factors contributing to customer churn. The goal is to derive insights that could help in reducing churn and improving customer retention.

## 🧠 Objectives

* Understand customer demographics and service usage.
* Identify trends and patterns between churn and features.
* Discover correlations and potential predictors of churn.
* Create meaningful visualizations for insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** for development environment

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values and corrected data types.
   * Performed basic summary statistics.

2. **Univariate Analysis**

   * Explored individual features (e.g., tenure, monthly charges).
   * Used bar plots, histograms, and pie charts.

3. **Bivariate Analysis**

   * Examined relationships between features and churn.
   * Created heatmaps, grouped bar charts, and violin plots.

4. **Churn Insights**

   * Identified high-risk segments (e.g., fiber optic users, month-to-month contracts).
   * Found important churn indicators like contract type, tenure, and total charges.

## 🔍 Insights

* Customers with month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate.
* Long-term customers tend to churn less.
* Services like fiber optic internet and online backup are associated with increased churn.
